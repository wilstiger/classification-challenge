# Classification Challenge: Spam Detector

This project is part of an effort to build a supervised machine learning model that can classify emails as **spam** or **not spam** for an Internet Service Provider (ISP). The goal is to improve the email filtering system by training and evaluating two classification models: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.

## Background

The ISP provided a dataset containing labeled email data to train the models. The dataset has two classes:
- `0`: Legitimate emails
- `1`: Spam emails

By training these models, we aim to:
1. Predict spam emails more accurately.
2. Evaluate the performance of each model based on accuracy.

---

## Features

- Implements **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier** using Python and Scikit-learn.
- Scales features using **StandardScaler** for better model performance.
- Outputs predictions for test data and evaluates models using accuracy scores.
- Includes a detailed markdown evaluation of model performances.
